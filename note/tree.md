## tree
- terminology
    - parent/child
    - root has no parent node
    - leaf has no children
- defines a tree
    - single root
    - each node only have one parent
    - no cycles in a tree
- generic tree
- binary tree
    - any parent can have at most two children
    - construction
        - have a linked structure
        - each node needs
            - a value
            - a parent
            - a left child
            - a right child
- traversals
    - pre-order traversals
        - bottom line: order we visit matters and we'll make choice based on our needs
    - post-order traversal
    - level order traversal
- binary search tree
    - construction
        - binary tree
        - left subtrees are less than parents
        - right subtrees are greater than parents
    - deletion
        - if only one child, hoist child
        - if two children, find smallest value in right subtree, 
            hoist that value up, delete the right subtree duplicate
    - height: max distance until leaf, normally around log(n) for balanced BST
    - balanced BST: leftHeight - rightHeight <= 1
        - **TreeSet** built in Java API
- trie
    - name comes from the word reTRIEval
    - differences
        - nodes can have more than 2 children
