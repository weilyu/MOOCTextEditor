- hiding irrelevant details to focus on the essential feature needed to understand and use a thing
- LinkedList
    - combined with nodes
    - each node has prev and next pointers
    - first node contain head, last node contain tail
    - singly linked list only have next pointer
    - ListNode
    - sentinel nodes
    - dummy nodes don't store anything
    - generic <E>
- testing practice
    - standard cycle
        - write code
        - write tests
        - test code
    - test-driven development
        - write tests
        - write code
        - test code
    - black box testing: only tests through the interface
    - clear box testing: test which know about the implementation
    - unit testing
        - JUnit
